# PROJECT DESCRIPTION 

This is the final project of a React frontend course. The goal of this project is to create a training app frontend using React that fetches data from a REST API and renders it for the user.

The app consists of a calendar view that displays all the scheduled trainings for the current month. The user can switch between different views such as day, week, or month, and can select a training to view its details. The details of a training include the activity, date, duration, and the person who conducted the training.

In addition to the calendar view, the app also includes a list view that displays all the scheduled trainings in a table format. The user can search for a specific training or filter by a specific category such as the activity type or the trainer's name.

The app also includes the ability to create new trainings and edit existing ones. The user can add the activity type, date, duration, and trainer's name, and the data is sent to the REST API to be stored in the database.

Furthermore, the app includes a statistics page that displays simple information about the training statistics.

Overall, this training app frontend provides a simple and intuitive interface for users to manage their training schedules, track their progress, and make data-driven decisions to improve their fitness goals.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
